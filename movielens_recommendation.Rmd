**Abstract**

```
Recommendations systems use ratings that users have given items to make specific recommendations to users. These ratings are usually in the range 1 to 5 stars, but there are some raters who give half stars. In this study, considering that the average rating of users has a certain stability, we propose a personalized fitting pattern to predict any missing ratings based on the similarity score set, which combines both the user-based and item-based. We will not use non-rating factors such as user’s (movie goer) age, gender, education, occupation, movie’s release date and price. However, we will use some vector adjustment to come up with least “RMSE”. We will use the experimental results on the MovieLens dataset to show that our proposed algorithms can increase the accuracy of our recommendation. That it can be used to predict what rating a given user will give a specific item. Items for which a high rating is predicted for specific users are then recommended to that user.

**Introduction**

```
This is the "Capstone Project: All Learners", In this project, we will be creating a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. In project we will be using the large version of the "MovieLens" dataset with 10 millions ratings of the latest movies.  We will be creating a recommendation system using all the tools we have used throughout the previous 8 courses in this series. Additioally, we will be using the provide "Test and Validation" script to create the "edx" and "validation" datasets.

The output of this process will be least "RMSE" ans predicated movie ratings.

# MovieLens 10M dataset:

dl <- tempfile()
download.file("http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip", dl)

ratings <- read.table(text = gsub("::", "\t", readLines(unzip(dl, "ml-10M100K/ratings.dat"))),
                      col.names = c("userId", "movieId", "rating", "timestamp"))

movies <- str_split_fixed(readLines(unzip(dl, "ml-10M100K/movies.dat")), "\\::", 3)
colnames(movies) <- c("movieId", "title", "genres")
movies <- as.data.frame(movies) %>% mutate(movieId = as.numeric(levels(movieId))[movieId],
                                           title = as.character(title),
                                           genres = as.character(genres))

movielens <- left_join(ratings, movies, by = "movieId")

# Validation set will be 10% of MovieLens data

set.seed(1) # if using R 3.6.0: set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")
test_index <- createDataPartition(y = movielens$rating, times = 1, p = 0.1, list = FALSE)
edx <- movielens[-test_index,]
temp <- movielens[test_index,]

# Make sure userId and movieId in validation set are also in edx set

validation <- temp %>% 
  semi_join(edx, by = "movieId") %>%
  semi_join(edx, by = "userId")

# Add rows removed from validation set back into edx set

removed <- anti_join(temp, validation)
edx <- rbind(edx, removed)

rm(dl, ratings, movies, test_index, temp, movielens, removed)
```


```
 Building the Recommendation System
 Creating the beginning RMSE
 
```
```{r}

validation <- validation %>% 
    semi_join(edx, by = movieId) %>%
    semi_join(edx, by = userId)

RMSE <- function(true_ratings, predicted_ratings){
  sqrt(mean((true_ratings - predicted_ratings)^2))
}

mu_hat <- mean(edx$rating)
mu_hat

naive_rmse <- RMSE(validation$rating, mu_hat)
naive_rmse

predictions <- rep(2.5, nrow(validation))
RMSE(validation$rating, predictions)

rmse_results <- data_frame(method = "Just the average", RMSE = naive_rmse)
```


```
The code below replaces the long running
# fit <- lm(rating ~ as.factor(userId), data = movielens)
Additionally, it computes the movie average ratings

```

```{r}
mu <- mean(edx$rating) 

movie_avgs <- edx %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(b_i = mean(rating - mu))
```


```
The folowing code block creates the user averages, predicted ratings and
builds the second model using user input plus the movie rating to improve
the RMSE.

```

```{r}
user_avgs <- validation %>%
        left_join(movie_avgs, by = "movieId") %>%
        group_by(userId) %>%
        summarize(b_u = mean(rating - mu - b_i))

predicted_ratings <- validation %>%
        left_join(movie_avgs, by = "movieId") %>%
        left_join(user_avgs, by = "userId") %>%
        mutate(pred = mu + b_i + b_u) %>% 
        .$pred

model_2_rmse <- RMSE(predicted_ratings, validation$rating)

```

```
This code block creates RMSE resuts using Movie + User effects Model
```

```{r}
rmse_results <- bind_rows(rmse_results,
                          data_frame(method = "Movie + User effects Model",
                                     RMSE = model_2_rmse))
```

```
This code block creates Histogram for the Movie effects only

```

```{r}
movie_avgs %>% qplot(b_i, geom ="histogram", 
                     bins = 10, data = ., color = I("black"))
```

```
This code block creates Histogram for the Movie effect + User effects

```

```{r}
user_avgs %>% qplot(b_u, geom ="histogram", 
                     bins = 10, data = ., color = I("blue"))
```

```
The following block of code creates the predicted ratings 
for Movie Effect Model and calculates the RMSE  for Movie effects 

```


```{r}
predicted_ratings <- mu + validation %>% 
                    left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
                    .$b_i

model_1_rmse <- RMSE(predicted_ratings, validation$rating)
rmse_results <- bind_rows(rmse_results,
                          data_frame(method="Movie Effect Model",
                                     RMSE = model_1_rmse ))

```

```
The following code creates a table with the three RMSE

```

```{r}
rmse_results %>% knitr::kable()

```

**Conclusion **

```
Base on the results in the above table, the Movie + User Effects Model 
yeilds the lowest RMSE of 0.8292477

```
